       <p id="tribute-info">   Aaron Lewis is a singer, songwriter and musician. Born April,13, 1972 in Rutland City, Vermont. He is most famous from his time as the Frontman for the band Stained. He began his music career at just 18 years old in 1990 and was at the time, with a band called J-CAT. Moving forward 9 years, Lewis was now with Stained. On October 31st of that year in Biloxi Mississippi, Stained was the first of 5 bands opening for Limp Bizkit, on the "Family Values" tour. Before their set, Lewis spoke with Fred Durst, Frontman for Limp Bizkit, about a song he wanted to perform during their set. Durst denied the request but told Lewis that if he would perform a song called "Outside", that he heard him playing around with a chorus for at an earlier date in Jacksonville Florida, he would come out and sing the chorus with him. Lewis agreed and left the dressing room where he began to sweat and shake from nervs. Unknown to Durst at the time, Lewis only had a chord progression and the chorus written and had just agreed to perform this song in front of 14,000 people. Durst came out as promised and sat on the stage near Lewis as he began to play and sing the song. During the first chorus, Durst realized that Lewis was making it up as he went along, which prompted him to say to the crowd <em>"This is the real *explitive* deal right here yall".</em> The performance was being recorded and "Outside" went on to be the song that launched Stained into popularity, with massive early support from Durst and Limp Bizkit.   
            <p id="paragraph">Lewis has since changed genres to country music, recording his first country album in 2010 with his hit song "Country Boy".</p>
